Dynamic neural network library

DyNet (formerly known as [cnn](http://github.com/clab/cnn-v1)) is a neural network library that is written in C++ with bindings in Python. It is designed to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU, and works well with networks that have dynamic structures that change for every training instance.
