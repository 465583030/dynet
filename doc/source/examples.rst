Examples
========

Here are some simple models coded in the examples of Dynet. Feel free to use and modify them.

Language models
---------------

Language modelling is one of the cornerstones of natural language processing. Dynet allows great flexibility in the creation of neural language models. Here are some examples.

Sequence to sequence models
---------------------------

Dynet is well suited for the variety of sequence to sequence models used in modern NLP. Here are some pre-coded structs implementing the most common one.
